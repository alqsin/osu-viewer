SOON
add slider repeat indicator
fix how sliders render (jagged + square ended)
allow beatmap to be paused
add combo colors and numbers
add slider/circle borders
create better spinner graphics?
determine proper approach circle radius
determine proper follow circle radius
add spinner score calculation
verify score calculation by fetching score via api
incorporate difficulty into score calculation
add api module which controls rate limit
add initialization of replay names to ids
add api request validation

EVENTUALLY
optimize rendering
  have TimeKeeper feed current state of subset of objects
  add FadeInStart and other properties to circles/sliders instead of passing as props
add key tracker
add actual graphics
add music + volume control
add mods
restucture project - get rid of create-react-app default files, sort out javascript files, etc.
serve react app with node (put build folder into node app I guess?)

LOW PRIORITY
improve/simplify/condense calculation process
  slider final tick shouldn't render
  either add ticks twice length of sliders or method-ize forward/reverse calculation (+ last tick) to not need to do it twice

????
final slider tick is calculated early
