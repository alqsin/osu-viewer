SOON
add slider repeat indicator
add combo colors and numbers
add slider/circle borders
create better spinner graphics?
determine proper approach circle radius
determine proper follow circle radius
add spinner score calculation
verify score calculation by fetching score via api
incorporate difficulty into score calculation
add api module which controls rate limit
add initialization of replay names to ids
add api request validation
improve sounds
  add volume control
  sync music and time properly
  add sounds besides music
import material design icon stylesheet in a better place

EVENTUALLY
optimize rendering
  have TimeKeeper feed current state of subset of objects
  add FadeInStart and other properties to circles/sliders instead of passing as props
add key tracker
add actual graphics
add mods
restructure project - get rid of create-react-app default files, sort out javascript files, etc.
serve react app with node (put build folder into node app I guess?)
add caching of replays (verify that score hasn't changed on api request)
add hp bar and circular time indicator

LOW PRIORITY
improve/simplify/condense calculation process
  slider final tick shouldn't render
  either add ticks twice length of sliders or method-ize forward/reverse calculation (+ last tick) to not need to do it twice

BUGS
music
  fails to playwhile alt tabbed
  errors when time is changed while autoplay is off (buffering issue?)
beatmap calculation incorrect
  hvick225 image material 2:09 miss doesn't break combo
some sliders render strangely
