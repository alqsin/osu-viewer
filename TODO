SOON
add slider repeat indicator
add combo colors and numbers
add slider/circle borders
verify score calculation by fetching score via api
incorporate difficulty into score calculation
add initialization of replay names to ids
add api request validation
improve sounds
  add volume control
  sync music and time properly
  add sounds besides music
import material design icon stylesheet in a better place
remove use of componentWillMount (marked as UNSAFE in React)
create "object" class for sliders, spinners and circles
status describing player/beatmap

EVENTUALLY
optimize rendering
  have TimeKeeper feed current state of subset of objects
  add FadeInStart and other properties to circles/sliders instead of passing as props
add key tracker
add actual graphics
add mods
serve react app with node (put build folder into node app I guess?)
add caching of replays (verify that score hasn't changed on api request)
add hp bar, circular time indicator and accuracy
add score screen (at time=end or separate?)
improve rate limiting
  add status (waiting for rate limit)
  make sure api call doesn't timeout

LOW PRIORITY
improve/simplify/condense calculation process
  slider final tick shouldn't render
  either add ticks twice length of sliders or method-ize forward/reverse calculation (+ last tick) to not need to do it twice
determine proper approach circle radius
determine exact follow circle radius
spinner improvements
  477 rpm limit
  figure out exactly how OD => spins required (50, 100, 300)
  spinning graphic
  display current rate

BUGS
music
  fails to play while alt tabbed
  errors when time is changed while autoplay is off (buffering issue?)
some sliders render strangely
